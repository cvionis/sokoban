TODO:
Do a level select screen instead of new/continue. Can make it in game, walk around and select levels
Need sounds for: create landing in slot, create leaving slot (maybe), door opening, door closing, leaving level
Reduce volume of step sound
Last level has a door in a weird place, it should not even have a door, possibly tile data not cleared properly
